# Ending-of-the-World
As already told earlier, I'm trying to find out how much time we have left on our beloved planet. Various factors such as Rise in the CO2 levels, overpopulation, pollution etc are gravely affecting our enviornment. We will have to look into historical data to predict future enviornmental conditions. To make these **predictions**, we will use **Machine** which will **Learn** these data and will help us to pin point the time of death of our world.

# 1) Rise in the CO2 Levels                                                                              
Scientists say that 350ppm of CO2 in atmosphere is safe and 450ppm of CO2 puts our planet at a high risk. So I used a simple historical CO2 levels dataset set to understand where we are and where we will go.                                                                             
The following graph really astonished me:

Global CO2 concentration had reached nearly 400ppm in 2015.

To make predictions I used a Linear Regression model in the last 40-50 years and got the following results:
